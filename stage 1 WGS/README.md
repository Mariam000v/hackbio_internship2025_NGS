Clinical Case Study: Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS)
Project Overview

This project investigates a 6-year-old boy with chronic lung infections and borderline cystic fibrosis (CF) test results using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The goal is to identify pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene and determine their inheritance.

Clinical Background

Patient: 6-year-old male with chronic cough, recurrent infections, and poor weight gain.

Clinical suspicion: Cystic Fibrosis (sweat chloride test: 45 mmol/L).

Family data: Father sequenced; mother’s genomic data unavailable.

Analysis Workflow

Quality Control & Alignment: Raw WGS reads mapped to the human reference genome.

Variant Calling: Performed for both child and father.

CFTR-focused Analysis: Variants in chromosome 7q31.2 identified and compared.

Inheritance Assessment: Child’s variants compared to father’s to determine familial or de novo origin.

Variant Annotation & Interpretation: Pathogenicity assessed using ClinVar and other variant databases.

Deliverables

Concise report (2–3 pages) with methods, results, and clinical interpretation.

Tables/visualizations of key variants (VCF excerpts, IGV screenshots, annotations).

Final conclusion on genetic basis of CF phenotype and inheritance pattern.

Notes

This repository is intended for educational purposes and illustrates bioinformatics workflow in a clinical WGS case study.
