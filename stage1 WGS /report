Clinical Case Study: Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS)
Clinical Background

A 6-year-old boy presents with chronic cough, recurrent lung infections, and poor weight gain. Borderline sweat chloride test (45 mmol/L) raises suspicion of cystic fibrosis (CF).

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the child and his father to investigate CFTR variants. Maternal genomic data are unavailable.

#WGS Workflow

1.Project setup

mkdir project1 qc_report


2.Quality control and trimming

fastqc raw_reads/*
bash scripts/fastp_multiqc_qc.sh


3.Genome alignment

bash scripts/bwa_samtools_align.sh


4.Variant calling

- Add Read Groups

Added read group information to sorted BAM files for child and father using GATK AddOrReplaceReadGroups.

Verified headers (@RG) and coordinate sorting.

- Mark Duplicates

Removed PCR duplicates with GATK MarkDuplicates.

Checked duplicate metrics and BAM headers for quality.

- Index BAM Files

Indexed deduplicated BAMs using samtools index for downstream analysis.

- Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR)

Performed BQSR on child and father BAMs using known SNP and indel sites.

Applied recalibration to produce final recalibrated BAMs.

- Variant Calling (CFTR-focused)

Used GATK HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode, restricted to CFTR locus (chr7:117480025-117668665).

Generated GVCFs for child and father.

Combine GVCFs and Joint Genotyping

Merged child and father GVCFs using GATK CombineGVCFs.

Performed joint genotyping with GATK GenotypeGVCFs to produce final family VCF.

- Quality Check

Confirmed variant calling by counting VCF entries using bcftools.

5.VEP annotation

#VCF variants annotated using Ensembl VEP online.

#Downloaded vep2.txt for downstream analysis in R.

#R-based CFTR Variant Analysis
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

vep_file <- "C:/.../vep2.txt"
vep_df <- read.delim(vep_file, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Filter CFTR variants
cftr_variants <- vep_df %>% filter(SYMBOL == "CFTR")

# Highlight common CF mutations
cf_mutations <- c("F508del","G542X","W1282X","N1303K","R117H","G551D")
cftr_variants <- cftr_variants %>%
  mutate(CF_related = ifelse(str_detect(HGVSp, paste(cf_mutations, collapse="|")), TRUE, FALSE))

# Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic variants
pathogenic_variants <- cftr_variants %>%
  filter(!is.na(CLIN_SIG) & str_detect(tolower(CLIN_SIG), "pathogenic"))

# CF-related phenotypes
cftr_cf_phenotypes <- cftr_variants %>%
  filter(!is.na(PHENO) & str_detect(PHENO, regex("Cystic|CFTR|BRONCHIECTASIS", ignore_case=TRUE)))

# Save outputs
write.csv(cftr_variants, "CFTR_all_variants.csv", row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(pathogenic_variants, "pathogenic_CFTR_variants.csv", row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(cftr_cf_phenotypes, "CFTR_CF_related_variants.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# Summary
cat("Total CFTR variants:", nrow(cftr_variants), "\n")
cat("CF-related mutations:", sum(cftr_variants$CF_related), "\n")
cat("Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic:", nrow(pathogenic_variants), "\n")
cat("Variants with CF-related phenotypes:", nrow(cftr_cf_phenotypes), "\n")

Results
- Category	Count
- Total CFTR variants	96
- CF-related mutations (common)	0
- Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic	37
- Variants with CF-related phenotypes	0

Note: No variants in this dataset were explicitly annotated with cystic fibrosis or CFTR-related phenotypes.

Clinical Interpretation

Several CFTR variants are pathogenic/likely pathogenic, but none have phenotype annotations linking them to CF in this VEP dataset.

The child may carry potentially disease-relevant variants, but no definitive CF-causing mutation is confirmed based on the available annotations.

Further targeted testing or functional validation is recommended to confirm CF diagnosis.

Conclusion

WGS identified CFTR variants in the child and father.

No variants had explicit CF-related phenotype annotations.

Genotype alone is insufficient to confirm cystic fibrosis; additional testing is advised.
