Clinical Case Study: Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS)
Clinical Background

A 6-year-old boy presents with chronic cough, recurrent lung infections, and poor weight gain despite adequate nutrition. His physician suspects cystic fibrosis (CF). A sweat chloride test has been ordered but yields borderline results (45 mmol/L).

To confirm diagnosis and identify the causative genetic variant(s), the clinical team orders whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

The boy’s father has also been sequenced as part of the family study. The mother’s genomic data are not available.

Task Overview

Objects:

1. Perform quality control and alignment of raw WGS reads to the human reference genome.

2. Call variants in both father and child.

3. Focus analysis on the CFTR locus (chromosome 7q31.2).

4. Compare the child’s variants against the father’s to determine inheritance patterns.

5. Annotate and interpret variants to identify known pathogenic CFTR mutations (ΔF508, G542X, W1282X, etc.) using databases such as ClinVar.

6. Conclude whether the child is affected by CF based on genotype, and note whether observed mutations are inherited or potentially de novo.

Methods
# Stage 1 WGS – Workflow

# 1. Project setup
pwd
mkdir project1
mkdir qc_report

# 2. Quality control & trimming
# Run FastQC
fastqc
fastqc

# Run QC + trimming + MultiQC
bash scripts/fastp_multiqc_qc.sh

# 3. Genome Mapping
# Align trimmed reads to reference genome
bash scripts/bwa_samtools_align.sh

# 4. Debugging scripts
# Repair read pairs and re-align
bash scripts/repair_father_reads.sh
bash scripts/fix_father_align.sh

# Check alignment outputs
ls -lh alignment_map/

# 5. Variant Calling
# Add read groups, mark duplicates, and generate BAM indices
bash scripts/varient_calling_debugged2.sh

# Run variant calling (HaplotypeCaller, CombineGVCFs, GenotypeGVCFs)
# Output VCFs will be in VCF/ folder

Clinical Interpretation

Based on the analysis of the CFTR gene and variant annotations:

1. Likely pathogenic variants: To be added later.

2. Genotype interpretation (affected, carrier, or unaffected): To be added later.

3. Inheritance pattern (inherited or de novo): To be added later.

Conclusion

To be added later.
