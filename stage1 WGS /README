 Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) – HackBio NGS Internship 2025

Clinical case: A 6-year-old boy with suspected Cystic Fibrosis (CF). WGS was performed on the child and father to identify pathogenic CFTR variants and assess inheritance.

Project Goals

- Perform QC and preprocessing of raw WGS reads
- Align reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38)
- Call and filter variants, focusing on the CFTR locus
- Annotate variants using ClinVar/dbSNP
- Interpret pathogenicity and inheritance patterns

Workflow Overview

- QC & Preprocessing: fastqc, multiqc, optional trimming (fastp)
- Alignment: BWA-MEM, sorting & indexing with samtools
- Variant Calling: GATK HaplotypeCaller
- Filtering: Focused on CFTR gene region
- Annotation & Interpretation: ClinVar, VEP/ANNOVAR, pathogenicity assessment

Skills Gained

- NGS data handling and quality control
- Genome alignment and BAM file processing
- Variant calling and filtering in clinical genomics
- Gene-focused variant annotation and interpretation
- Understanding of Mendelian inheritance and CFTR genetics
- Practical experience with GATK, samtools, bcftools, and variant databases
