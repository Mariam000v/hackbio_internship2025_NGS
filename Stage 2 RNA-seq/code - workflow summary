RNA-seq Project â€“ Workflow

This document summarizes the main steps of the RNA-seq project (Project 2).

1. Project setup
# Create project directory
mkdir project2

2. Data download
# Download data using SRA Explorer via bash script
nano download_data.sh

# Move FASTQ files to a single folder
mkdir raw_data
mv *fastq.gz raw_data/

3. Quality Control
# Create folder for QC results
mkdir qc_result

# Run FastQC on all raw FASTQ files
fastqc raw_data/* -o qc_result

# List QC results
ls -lh qc_result

# Check that 16 FASTQ reports were generated
ls qc_result/*fastqc.html | wc -l
ls qc_result/*fastqc.zip | wc -l

4. MultiQC Summary
# Generate MultiQC report for QC results
mkdir multiqc
multiqc qc_result/ -o multiqc/

# List MultiQC output
ls multiqc/

5. Trimming
# Create folder for trimmed reads
mkdir trim

# Create trimming script
nano trimmer.sh

# Run trimming script
cd raw_data
./trimmer.sh/

# Move trimmed reads and Fastp reports
mv raw_data/trimmed trim/
mv raw_data/fastp_report trim/

# Run MultiQC on trimming reports
multiqc trim/fastp_reports/ -o multiqc_trim/

6. Mapping
# Mapping with STAR (to be added)

7. Differential Expression Analysis
# Differential expression analysis (DESeq2, edgeR, or other)
# To be added later

8. Gene Ontology / Pathway Enrichment
# Functional enrichment analysis of DE genes
# Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis
# To be added later
