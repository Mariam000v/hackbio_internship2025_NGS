RNA-seq Analysis of Bipolar II Disorder (HackBio NGS Internship 2025)

This project was completed as part of the HackBio NGS Internship 2025, focusing on RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling of iPSC-derived microglia from Bipolar II Disorder (BD-II) patients and healthy controls. The goal was to explore molecular differences between familial and sporadic BD-II using standard NGS and bioinformatics techniques.
